We are the middle men in the widget market. your job is to buy widgets from the widget producer companies and sell them to the widget consumer companies.
Each widget consumer company has an open requestfor one widget per day, until some end date, and a price at which it is willing to buy the widgets. On the
other hand,each widgets producer company has a start date at which it can start delivering widgets and a price at whichit will deliver each widget.

Due to fair competition laws, you can sign a contract with only one producer company and only one consumer company. You will buy widgets from the 
producer company, one per day, starting on the day it canstart delivering, and ending on the date specified by the consumer company. On each of those days
you earn the difference between the producer's selling price and the consumer's buying price.

        p = [price, date]
        company_info.append(p)
